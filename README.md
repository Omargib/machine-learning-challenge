Conclusions

I used 2 models (logistics regression model & SVC).

Comparing the two models I guess that both of them are pretty similar I got almost the same outcome.

Certainly, I didn't understand the data quite well because they are astrophysics measurements and I am not related to them, 
but I think that I got closer to the expected result and the models work.
